# Project_Portfolio

This is the repository for my project portfolio

My guideline for how I organized the directory:

Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing gives the following recommendations for project organization:

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
4. Put source for the projectâ€™s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.
5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.
