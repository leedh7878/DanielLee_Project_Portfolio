# Project_Portfolio

This is the repository for my project portfolio

## Here's My [guideline](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/References/page_organization) for how I organized the repositories: 


# Project description:

## [Project 1. Power BI Project: Maven Coffee Challenge ("The Great American Coffee Taste Test")](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/13111)

- Employ Power Query for comprehensive data transformation, including cleaning, pivoting, and merging operations.

- Normalized a substantial dataset from a single file, comprising multiple tables, and established a coherent data model complete with relationships.

- Generated explicit measures using DAX functions.

- Designed an interactive report providing a comprehensive overview of data from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test."

- Created visuals including matrices, bar charts, donut charts, treemaps, and decomposition trees.

## [Project 2. Maternal Health Analysis with R programming](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/tree/main/Maternal_Health_Risk)

[Published R Notebook Report](Maternal_Health_Risk/src/EDA.html)

- Leveraged ggplot2 and dplyr packages to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insightful visualizations like histograms, scatter plots,box plots, and correlation matrix to discover patterns, distributions, and potential outliers within the maternal health dataset.

- Utilized the MASS package in R to build and fit an ordinal logistic regression model, predicting Risk Level (an ordered categorical variable) using numerical predictors such as SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, and Blood Glucose, while interpreting coefficients and odds ratios to evaluate the impact of each variable.

- Applied statistical testing using p-values and confidence intervals to assess the significance of numerical predictors in the model, confirming the role of Blood Glucose as a significant variable, while identifying DiastolicBP as statistically insignificant in predicting Risk Level.

## [Project 3. Water Quality: ](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Water_Quality_Potability/src/water_quality.ipynb)

[<u>Data Source</u>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/water-quality-and-potability)

- Imputation and oversampling techniques have been applied for the first time, although their impact on the data outcome remains uncertain.

- Various classification methods have been utilized to assess the accuracy of predictions.

- ROC curves and confusion matrices have been generated for visualization.

## [Project 6. NLP Python Project: College students' food and cooking preferences:](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Food_Choice/src/Food_Choice_%20Data_Cleansing.ipynb)

- Engaging in a Python project focused on tasks such as data cleaning, natural language processing, and exploratory data analysis.

- The NLTK package was employed to optimize natural language processing.

- Create a grammar to extract food item names from unformatted strings and present them in a list format.

## [Project 8. Tableau Project: Olympic Medalist](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/donghyun6358/viz/Personal_Project_16906002812120/Dashboard1)

- The objective of this project is to visualize the number of medals earned in the Olympics.

- Users can select a country directly from the map.

- Dropdown filters are available for country, medal type, and sport types.

- The year of the Olympics can be chosen using a slider.

- A reset button is provided to clear applied filters and reset the display.

- The bar graph will provide a clear and concise overview of medal counts based on the selected filters.
