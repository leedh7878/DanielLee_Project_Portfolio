## [Project 1. Power BI Project: Maven Coffee Challenge ("The Great American Coffee Taste Test")](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/13111)

[<u>Data Source</u>](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-coffee-challenge/30)

- Employ Power Query for comprehensive data transformation, including cleaning, pivoting, and merging operations.

- Normalized a substantial dataset from a single file, comprising multiple tables, and established a coherent data model complete with relationships.

- Generated explicit measures using DAX functions.

- Designed an interactive report providing a comprehensive overview of data from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test."

- Created visuals including matrices, bar charts, donut charts, treemaps, and decomposition trees.

## [Project 2. Maternal Health Analysis with R programming](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/tree/main/Maternal_Health_Risk)

[Published R Notebook Report](Maternal_Health_Risk/src/EDA.html)

[<u>Data Source</u>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data/data)

- Leveraged ggplot2 and dplyr packages to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insightful visualizations like histograms, scatter plots,box plots, and correlation matrix to discover patterns, distributions, and potential outliers within the maternal health dataset.

- Utilized the MASS package in R to build and fit an ordinal logistic regression model, predicting Risk Level (an ordered categorical variable) using numerical predictors such as SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, and Blood Glucose, while interpreting coefficients and odds ratios to evaluate the impact of each variable.

- Applied statistical testing using p-values and confidence intervals to assess the significance of numerical predictors in the model, confirming the role of Blood Glucose as a significant variable, while identifying DiastolicBP as statistically insignificant in predicting Risk Level.


## [Project 3. Water Portability Prediction ](https://github.com/leedh7878/DanielLee_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Water_Quality_Potability/src/water_quality.ipynb)

[Published Jupyter Notebook Report](Water_Quality_Potability/src/water_quality.html)

[<u>Data Source</u>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/water-quality-and-potability)

- Conducted comprehensive EDA to explore patterns and relationships, followed by imputation and scaling to handle missing values and standardize features. Addressed data imbalance effectively by applying SMOTE to enhance minority class representation.  

- Built and evaluated multiple classifiers, prioritizing recall to minimize false negatives, which is critical for water quality evaluation. Used custom scoring metrics during cross-validation to identify underperforming models for elimination.  

- Performed hyperparameter tuning to refine model parameters and threshold tuning to find the optimal balance between precision and recall. Focused on maximizing recall while maintaining overall model performance.  

- Achieved significant improvements in Random Forest classifier performance, increasing recall from 0.48 to 0.84.
