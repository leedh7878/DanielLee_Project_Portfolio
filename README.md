[Click on this link to access the Shiny application](https://leedh7878.shinyapps.io/NOAA_Shinyapp/)

- Develop a Shiny app to access and efficiently present precipitation data for weather stations in Washington State, sourced from the NOAA API

- Enable users to choose a specific year from the available range of 2000 to 2003.

- Provide an interactive interface to visualize the monthly precipitation data for the selected year.

- Implement a bar graph that highlights the top 5 areas (stations) with the highest recorded precipitation levels.

- Display the precipitation data on a map, utilizing circles where the size of each circle corresponds to the precipitation value.
