There are several advantages to using Python files over Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, including:

Reproducibility: Python files allow for easier reproducibility of data analysis. Since Python files are saved as scripts, they can be version-controlled using tools like Git. This means that the analysis can be easily reproduced and shared with others, without having to rely on a specific environment or notebook.

Scalability: Python files are better suited for larger projects and more complex analyses. They allow for more organization and modularization of code, which makes it easier to manage large datasets and complex data pipelines.

Testing: Python files can be easily tested using automated testing frameworks, which allows for faster and more reliable development of data analysis workflows.

Efficiency: Python files can be run from the command line or as part of a larger workflow, which can be more efficient than running a Jupyter notebook. This can be particularly useful for running analyses on large datasets or for running analyses in a distributed computing environment.

Collaboration: Python files are better suited for collaboration between team members. Since Python files are saved as text files, they can be easily shared, reviewed, and collaborated on using tools like GitHub.
